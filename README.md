# ShiddyZoneMusicTool
A tool written for my revelations-style zone specific round sounds.

Takes a zonename and sound files and outputs:
  - GSC lines for the zone specific round sound array for that zone
  - CSV lines for a sound alias file.
  
This is an example of functional python code, not pretty. 
I will come back and update it though, probably...

Windows Defender will probably flag the EXE as dangerous but will still let you run it.

If you're still skeptical, don't worry, I feel you dog, so you can pull the python script directly from this repo
and run it from source ðŸ˜Ž

You might need to install python and install tkinter, but that's on you.
